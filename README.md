# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the Analysis:

I have created an earthquake map that has two different maps ("Streets" and "Dark") and an overlay of the earthquake data. The client has requested 3 deliverables. The first deliverable is to have the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth displayed as an overlay. The second is create another overlay that shows all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. The third and last deliverable is to have a third map option to display the data.

## Resources:

- Data Sources: challenge_logic.js, logic.js, style.css, index.html
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.54 with LiveServer, Web Browser Console

## Results:

### Deliverable 1:

Overlay showing the tectonic plates.
